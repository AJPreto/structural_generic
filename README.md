# Structural Biochemistry

Repository for .PDB files analysis.

**Consurf visualization**:
- replaces b-factor values with consurf values on a ".pdb" file.

**Residues distance**:
- Calculate the distance between two amino acids by their alpha carbons, upon a ".pdb" file. 

**RMSD**:
- Calculate overall RMSD between a template and all the remaining ".pdb" files in the folder.

**Clustal to ali**:
- Convert a Clustal Omega alignment to a ".ali" file (Modeller friendly input). 

**Proq**:
- Input a ".pdb" file to retrieve LGScore and MaxSub evaluation. Secondary structure submission is possible.

**Haddock**:
- Input a ".pdb" dimer file to perform interface refinement. Confirm chromedriver version prior to usage.

**Correct animo acid**:
- Input a ".pdb" file to correct an amino acid name on the whole file. Can also be used on all the files in the folder.

**Center coordinates**:
- Input a ".pdb" file to attain an output with the coordinates geometrically centered.

**Interface class**:
- input a ".pdb" file to attain a interfacial classification of a dimer chain.

**Renumber pdb**:
- input a ".pdb" file to attain the renumbered (from 1) ".pdb file".

**Query Uniprot and PDB**
- input a csv table and find UniProt and PDBids.
- retrieve protein structure and sequence.
